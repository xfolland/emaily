# Emaily

This project was part of the [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/) course by Stephen Grider.

It requires the following environment variables:

- COOKIE_KEY
- GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
- MONGO_URI
- REDIRECT_DOMAIN
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

The REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY environment variable in client/.env.production should be changed to your own as well.

It may be available online in the future.
